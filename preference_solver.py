#	The program reads txt files composed of rules in the following format:
#		(b, h), where a and b are formulas of propositional logic
#		b is the "body" of the rule, while h is the "head"
#		"&" is used for "and", "|" is used for "or", and "~" is used for negation
#		Example: ( (~P | (~Q | R)), (Q & P) )
#
#		The program makes use of the SAT solver included in sympy, which requires mpath
#		It also utilizes the Symbol object, with which formulas are encoded for the purpose of using the SAT solver
